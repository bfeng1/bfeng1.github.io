## Data Analysis Project 1: Gait Analysis Performance Comparison

**Project description:** 
We have a running dataset that was collected using our proposed markerless gait analysis system, and another dataset was collected simultaneously by Qualisys(a marker-based gait analysis system that is the standard of the current market). We want to compare the accuracy of our system using the Qualisys system as the golden rule and find the areas of improvement. The main objectives for this analysis are:
* compare the knee angle measurements from two systems
* compare the ankle angle measurements from two systems
* create visualizations for both systems and angles

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
