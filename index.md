### Projects

**Machine Learning**

[Computer Vision: YOLOv8 on Traffic Detection](/machine_learning_p0)

In this project, we utilized the YOLO model for traffic detection, starting with familiarization and testing of a pre-trained model. Then, we have fine-tuned the model with our dataset. The retrained model shows a significantly improved performance. We have also analyzed different metrics and plots obtained during the training process. All of those plots show the confirmation of enhanced accuracy.

**Skills: Python, Computer Vision, Model Finetuning, Metrics Evaluation**

[Regression Problem: House Price Prediction](/machine_learning_p1)

Throughout the project, we have performed exploration data analysis to understand the dataset and the relationship between given features and the house price. Then, we cleaned and preprocessed the dataset. Lastly, We aimed to create a model that can predict house prices with only the provided features. As we can see from the final results, we can obtain a pretty decent performance using the random forest regression model on the unseen data.

**Skills: Python, Regression Model, EDA, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineer**

**Data Analysis**

[Gait Analysis Performance Comparison](/data_analysis_p1)

We have a running dataset that was collected using our proposed markerless gait analysis system, and another dataset was collected simultaneously by Qualisys(a marker-based gait analysis system that is the standard of the current market). We want to compare the accuracy of our system using the Qualisys system as the golden rule and find the areas of improvement.
