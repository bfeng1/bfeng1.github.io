## Data Analysis Project 2: Data Science Salary Analysis

**Project description:** 
In an age dominated by data, the field of data science stands as a beacon of innovation and opportunity. Behind every groundbreaking discovery, and every insightful trend lies a team of dedicated professionals armed with the tools of analysis and the power of visualization. Welcome to our exploration of the dynamic landscape of data science careers and salaries, where numbers tell stories and trends reveal themselves in vibrant hues. The main objectives for this project are:
* Dive deep into each variable provided in the dataset
* Ask meaningful questions and discover insights
* Create easy-to-understand visualization to conduct data analysis results

### 1. Familiar with the dataset used in the analysis and its limitations

Check the dataset's source and realize the limitations of the dataset. It only contains about 9.3K job samples, and most of them are collected in the US, with the majority of the samples from the year 2023. 

### 2. Answer meaningful questions

We will come up with meaningful questions related to the dataset that could be interesting to the readers. Here are some examples:
* What are the salary expectations for data science jobs in the US?
* How does the work setting affect the salary for the same job?
* How does seniority affect the salary within one category?

### 3. Create easy-to-interpret visualizations

### 4. Conclusion

Being familiar with different styles of visualization is critical for driving values through data science. Easy-to-interpret graphs can help close the gaps between technical and non-technical team members. This project aims to practice asking critical questions for the audience and answering them through simple visualization.
